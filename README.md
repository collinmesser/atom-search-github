# Search-Github Atom Package

This package allows you to highlight some text in Atom and search for it in GitHub. You can also specificy a specific GitHub repository in the package settings if you consistently are searching in a single repo.

The default search url is `https://www.github.com`. You can edit this in the package settings to be any GitHub repo that you'd like. For instance `https://github.com/atom/atom`.

***Note: Do not include the trailing slash / after the url.***
